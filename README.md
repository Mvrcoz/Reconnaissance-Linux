# Performing Active Reconnaissance with Linux
**Objective**: Utilized Linux tools like Nmap for active reconnaissance on target networks.

## Tools Used
- **Nmap and Zenmap**: Network scanning and mapping tools.
- **OpenVAS**: Used for vulnerability assessments.

## Key Concepts
- **Network Reconnaissance**: Techniques for gathering information about network infrastructure.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Using OpenVAS to identify potential security weaknesses.

## Lab Overview
1. **Network Scans**: Conducted scans to identify open ports and operating systems.
2. **OpenVAS Vulnerability Assessment**: Analyzed vulnerabilities and created reports.

## Learnings
- Practical knowledge of reconnaissance techniques.
- Experienced how vulnerability assessments reveal security gaps.
